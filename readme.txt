Alien Infestation, a 48 hour speedmod made on 2006-04-12 through 2006-04-14 by
LordHavoc for the Quake Speed Modding event at http://speedqc.errorabove.com/

This modification implements the 3 monster models (ballmech/clinger/young)
supplied for the speedmod, and includes a singleplayer/deathmatch level
(aimap1).

The monsters also randomly replace grunts, ogres, scrags, and fiends in quake.

How to play:
Load up aimap1 in deathmatch or singleplayer/coop, or play quake levels,
no extra keys to bind or anything like that.

In deathmatch the respawning clinger/young monsters are a hazard to spice up
the game a bit, in singleplayer/coop they are normal monsters.

Note that more young are dropped by clingers on higher skill settings:
2 on easy
4 on normal
6 on hard
8 on nightmare
This applies even in deathmatch.

I spent most of the 48 hours making the map or sleeping, only about 4 hours of
work was put into the qc.
